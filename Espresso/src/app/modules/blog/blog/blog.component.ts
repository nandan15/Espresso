    <title>Accent Walls: The Power of Focus</title>
    <p>An accent wall is a classic way to draw attention to a specific area of a room. Choose a wall that serves as a focal point, such as the one behind your bed, sofa, or dining table. Opt for a bold yet complementary color that contrasts with the rest of the room. Rich jewel tones like emerald green, deep navy, or burgundy add a sense of luxury, while softer shades like blush pink, sage green, or light gray exude calm elegance. If you're feeling adventurous, explore textured paints or wallpapers for added dimension.</p>
